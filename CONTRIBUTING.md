# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. If you find a bug or have an idea, open an issue first so we can discuss.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests if they exist (`pytest`)
5. Open a pull request

## Guidelines

- Keep changes focused — one PR per feature or fix
- Follow existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality when possible
